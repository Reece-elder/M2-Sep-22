# Object Oriented Programming Principles

Are guidelines / functionality your code should have to be considered object focused:
- Inheritance
    Objects can inherit values and functions from parent objects, all objects are inheriting some data from something 

- Encapsulation
    Objects and classes only having access to the data they need for it to function, improve security and to decouple processes so they are not as reliant on each other 

- Abstraction
    Making classes where you can't create objects out of them

- Polymorphism
    Ideal of Object Oriented programming, All objects are objects of something else, any inherited objects are also objects of (Python)
