# Python Virtual Enviornment

Have Python installed locally on our machines with all of our extra packages stored locally
We haven't organised our projects, and all installed packages are available to all projects 

Virtual env allow us to create a new installation of Python where we can:
- Specify the version of python
- Manage the packages used
- Manage the config of this project 

`python -m venv <name of virtual env>`
`source <name of env>/Scripts/activate` to activate the virtual environment through linux / bash
Make sure to create a .gitignore
